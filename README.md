# pBB Recall Harvester

## About

Created by pointless for his lumberjack and miner, shared to BB.

Supposed to be a harvester that requires minimum human intervention (other than captcha, and the occasional emergency recalls). I recommend that you use my recommended skills, but if you can't then just to make sure to mark SAFE locations without aggressive spawns.

Please do not distribute outside of the guild!!!  

## Requirements

- 1xFully Marked Rune Tome (in bank, supports up to four)

- A harvester with:  
*60 Magery, recall of target*
*70 Camping, if mining*

### Recommended

- 50 Animal Lore/Taming
- >= 40 Healing
- 3-5 x Slots Bonded Pets (Recommend Mucks at least at lvl 6 for regen, but it depends on where you mark as well. I ran it with 1xColossal Frog 1xMuck and 1xFamiliar too)
- Whatever you can spare in meditation.

## Setup

This is the most time consuming part. If you already have the resources, changing your character to the required build is very little effort. Try to spend a little extra time on finding good spots. You may find that you over time start replacing some nodes where you often come home early.

### 1,2 ... 8

1. Mark runes to fill up  your tome(s). Look for good spots. Anything with multiple of that resource around you. If trees, standing in the middle of alot of trees. If mining, having mountain in all directions.  

2. Add the scripts in this repository. **Name them exactly as mine, this is very important**

3. Make sure you have one bag in your bank with alot of regs (bp, mr, bm), tools and bandages.

4. Make sure you have one bag in your bank where ore will be stored.

5. Make sure to carry either a recall rune to a bank, or a blessed runebook with default set to bank. (Personally I don't have enough runebooks, I just mark a bunch of runes as backup)

6. Go to a bank of your choice.

7. Make sure you have **ONE tool in your backpack**. Either hatchet or pickaxe. This will determine what mode the harvester is in.

8. Start script *pBBHarvesterSetup* and follow instructions in game.

**Happy farming!**  
*DM me if you have any issues*

## Hints and tips

- If you log out mid session, remember to open the restock container once when you log in again. Or you might get stopped by missing regs.

- Set a hotkey to *pBBHarvester*, set a hotkey for "Stop macro" and set a hotkey for utility script pBBEmergency. I use F1 and F2 and Pause for stop.

- Use the highest tier pickaxe possible. I did/will do Iron->Gold->Agapite->Verite->Valo. You want success rates.

- If you have Fortune this helps success rates and in turn better *oph*

## Changelog
